# 🐀 SWISSINNO BLE Trap Integration for Home Assistant

A **custom Home Assistant integration** for **SWISSINNO Connect SuperCat and electronic SuperCat traps**, enabling real-time monitoring over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

Supported Connect/legacy devices also expose **remote trap reset**. Electronic high-voltage traps require a physical power cycle for safety, as documented by SWISSINNO, and therefore do not expose a reset button.

# 🚀 Features

### ✔️ Automatic BLE Scanning  
Detects traps instantly — no pairing or manual configuration required.

### ✔️ Trap Status Monitoring  
Real-time detection of **triggered vs. ready** state.

### ✔️ Battery Voltage Sensor  
Accurate battery readings with automatic updates and transient-value filtering.

### ✔️ RSSI (Signal Strength) Sensor  
Helps you place traps for optimal Bluetooth coverage.

### ✔️ Remote BLE Reset
Supported Connect/legacy traps expose a **Reset Trap** button in Home Assistant.
Electronic high-voltage traps intentionally require switching off and on again.

### ✔️ Lovelace UI Support  
Includes example cards with icons, states, and reset control.

### ✔️ Fully Plug-and-Play  
No YAML needed. Everything is auto-discovered.

# 📥 Installation

## 1️⃣ Manual Installation
1. Download (or clone) the `custom_components/swissinno_ble` folder.  
2. Place it inside your Home Assistant:  

```
config/custom_components/
```

3. Restart Home Assistant.  
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → SWISSINNO BLE**.

---

## 2️⃣ HACS Installation
1. Open **HACS → Integrations**  
2. Click **+ Explore & Add Repositories**  
3. Add this repository:

```
https://github.com/unigas/swissinno_ble
```

4. Choose **Integration**  
5. Install and restart Home Assistant  
6. Add the integration from **Settings → Devices & Services**

The integration will immediately begin scanning for nearby traps.

# ⚙️ Configuration

No YAML configuration is needed.  
When a trap is detected, the following entities are created automatically:

### Entities per trap:
- `binary_sensor.swissinno_trap_<ID>` – **Trap triggered / ready**
- `sensor.swissinno_battery_<ID>` – **Battery voltage**
- `sensor.swissinno_rssi_<ID>` – **Bluetooth signal strength**
- `button.swissinno_trap_<ID>_reset` – **Reset Trap** (supported Connect/legacy devices only)

---

# 🔘 Reset Trap (BLE Write Support)

Supported Connect/legacy devices include a **Reset Trap** button entity that resets the catch sensor using Bluetooth. SWISSINNO disables app reset on electronic high-voltage traps for safety, so the integration does not create a reset button for those devices.

### BLE Command Details
- **Characteristic UUID:** `02ECC6CD-2B43-4DB5-96E6-EDE92CF8778D`  
- **Payload:** `0x00`  
- **Transport:** Home Assistant Bluetooth (supports proxies like ESPHome)

### Example Automation

```yaml
alias: Auto Reset Trap After Notification
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: mobile_app_notification_action
    event_data:
      action: reset_kitchen_trap
action:
  - service: button.press
    target:
      entity_id: button.swissinno_trap_DC140300_reset
```

Replace `DC140300` with your own trap ID.

# 📊 Lovelace Dashboard Example

```yaml
type: entities
title: 🐀 SWISSINNO Trap — Kitchen
show_header_toggle: false
entities:
  - entity: binary_sensor.swissinno_trap_DC140300
    name: Trap Status
    state_color: true
    icon: mdi:rodent

  - type: custom:template-entity-row
    entity: sensor.swissinno_battery_DC140300
    name: Battery Level
    state: "{{ states('sensor.swissinno_battery_DC140300') | round(2) }} V"

  - entity: sensor.swissinno_rssi_DC140300
    name: Signal Strength

  - entity: button.swissinno_trap_DC140300_reset
    name: Reset Trap
```

💡 Tip: Install **Lovelace Template Entity Row** via HACS.

# 🛠 Troubleshooting

### ❓ No traps found?
- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled  
- ESPHome BLE proxies must be online  
- Try restarting Home Assistant  

### ❓ Wrong battery level?
Correct conversion formula:

```
Voltage = (raw * 3.6) / 255
```

### ❓ Trap state updates slowly?
Move the trap closer to the receiver or use more BLE proxies.
